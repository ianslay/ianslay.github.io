    Looking though a thrift shop a few months ago I found this 90s keyboard with nice feeling switches.I bought it and planed on using it for my desktop computer. However this keyboard uses the AT 5-pin DIN connector, so it is not as simple as buying a passive apter and plugging everything together and calling it a day. This is how I made it work.

    To convert from the AT out of the keyboard to a usb input for a modern computer to understand an active converter must be used. Luckily others have wanted to do this before me. Soarer a user on the [deskthority](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2510&start=) and [geekhack](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=17458.0) forums has posted code for a converter.
