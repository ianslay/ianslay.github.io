Hello, welcome to my website!

My name is Ian Slay.  I have a keenness to tinker and create.

Currently I am an electronics student at Miami Dade College.  As of June 2020 I received my Electronics Engineering Technology Associate in Science Degree.  

I made this website to provide a structured archive to log my projects and ideas.  If you would like to collaborate or have any questions, visit my contact page. 

ianslay.com is using:
 [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host.
 [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build.
 The [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) Jekyll theme.
